        strong TRIVIA

      p The name Herp Project refers to 
        strong Herp Derp. 
        | (Roughly translates into 
        strong Stupid Project
        | )
        p We chose that name when we were developing our first project together, which was supposed to be a 
          strong parody 
          | of a popular video game series.
        p After around two years of working on it, and choosing mid-way through it to develop our own game engine, we discovered that we were 
          | shooting way over our heads with this one 
          | and moved to work on other things.
