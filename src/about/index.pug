        strong TRIVIA

      p The name Herp Project refers to 
        strong Herp Derp. 
        | Which translates our name to 
        strong Stupid Project.
        p We chose that name when we were developing our first project, which was supposed to be a 
          strong parody 
          | of a popular video game series.
        p After two years of working on that single project, we discovered that we're 
          strong shooting way over our heads?? 
          | And moved to develop other projects.
